## Precautions for extension tools



1. Only tool category folders can be stored in libs

2. The tool script in the tool category folder must use a function or class with the same name as the script to load the code of the entire tool. For example, 'tools. py' tools must use 'class tools' or' def tools' to load the entire tool

3. The cache files in the 'tmp' directory will be cleared each time the tool is started
